Draw It Or Lose It

The Gaming Room requested a sofware design template for their game "Draw It Or Lose It" They wanted us to aid in the design of server sofware and client-side software as well.

We feel as if the Evalation was particularly well done and usefull to our client (The gaming Room). It showed the potential that the most popular operating ystems have in all the different required fields (client, server, development).


I feel that although the design template may not have helped us as much as it helped "The Gaming Room", since the start we had a pretty good idea of what the requirements were, and mostly used the design template to get our desicions accross to our employer.


If we were to go back and revise this template, we would focus on the first section (Executive Summary) as we feel it could do with a more in-depth explenation.

We considered many factors that focus on the users needs, one being the fact that different users will have different hardware and software. We need to take this into consideration because the experience may be drasticly different on a mobile device vs. a desktop. It's important to take these types of things into consideration because the user is the most important, they are the custemers and if The Gaming Room wants to make sure to keep a user base long after development is finished, then they will keep this in mind.

We approuched the creation of this design temoplate starting with the code itself, but in the future we will most likely start by getting a very simple idea of whats required, then pick out an OS and archetecture, before building in top of that to flesh out the actual code.
